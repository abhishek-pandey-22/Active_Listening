## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?<br>
   
<b> Orientation</b> - The first step is about getting to know each other. Here members feel uncomfortable due to a lack of communication. The group tends to experience primary tension. Interpretation and agreement happen in this phase as part of getting to know each other. <br>
<b> Conflict </b>-  In this stage, the problem is examined and each individual tries to convey get into a solution through their perspective.<br>
<b>Emergence </b>-  Group’s task and its arrangement become noticeable. In this stage uncertainty increases but the responses are kept quiet.<br>
<b>Reinforcement</b> - This is the final stage of small-group communication. Here the members try to observe their final decision through an array of their viewpoints. <br>

Seeking to understand a speaker's idea, then offering the idea back to the speaker, to confirm the idea has been understood correctly. First, we need to know what is Fisher model, It is a development model consisting of four stages. An accord is emerging within a group by going through the above stages. 


## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?<br>

#### At the time of listening there happen some obstacles like:-
 * Physiological Barriers: - some people may have genuine hearing problems or
deficiencies that prevent them from listening properly. 

* Physical Barriers: - These referred to distractions in the environment such as the
sound of an air conditioner, cigarette smoke, or an overheated room.

* Attitudinal Barriers:- preoccupation with personal or work-related problems
can make it difficult to focus one’s attention completely on what the speaker is
saying, even what is being said is of very importance.

* Wrong 

Assumptions:- The success of communication depend on both the
sender and receiver. It is wrong to assume that communication is the sole
responsibility of the sender or the speaker and that listeners have no role to play.
Such an assumption can be a big barrier to listening.

* Cultural Barriers:- Accents can be barriers to listening since they interfere
with the ability to understand the meaning of words that are pronounced
differently.

* Lack of Training:- Listening is not an inborn skill. People are not born good
listeners. It is developed through practice and training.<br>

## 5. When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?<br>

As We’ve Already Established, Passive Communication Is An Ineffective Way Of Getting One’s Views Across. Passive Communicators Rarely Express Their Needs, Thoughts, Or Feelings In Public. Instead, They Hide Their Emotions And Let Others ‘Walk Over Them’. While A Passive Communication Style May Seem Harmless, It’s Not. Because It Makes People Believe That Such Communicators Are Powerless, Pushovers, Or Uninterested, When That May Be Far From The Truth.<br>For any individual it developed a pattern of avoiding expressing their opinions or feelings, protecting their rights, and identifying and meeting their needs then it makes such type of communication.

“I’m Unable To Stand Up For What I Believe In”

“I Just Want To Keep The Peace”

“I Will Always Agree With You Because You’re So Much Smarter Than Me!”

“You’re Right, It Was My Fault. I’m A Horrible Human Being”<br>

 No, I am not into Aggressive communication styles in any way.<br>

## 7. When do you switch to Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?<br>

It happens to me very occasionally <br> It happens because of the development of the pattern of avoiding expressing their opinions or feelings, protecting their rights, and identifying and meeting their needs.
