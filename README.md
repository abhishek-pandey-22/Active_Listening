What are the obstacles in your listening process?

-> At time of listening there happen some obstacles like:-
 1. Physiological Barriers: - some people may have genuine hearing problems or
deficiencies that prevent them from listening properly.

sound of an air conditioner , cigarette smoke, or an overheated room.

can make it difficult to focus one’s attention completely on what speaker is
saying, even what is being said is of very importance.

4. Wrong Assumptions :- The success of communication depend on the both the
sender and receiver. It is wrong to assume that communication is the sole
responsibility of the sender or the speaker and that listeners have no role to play.

with the ability to understand the meaning of words that are pronounced

When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

As We’ve Already Established, Passive Communication Is An Ineffective Way Of Getting One’s Views Across. Passive Communicators Rarely Express Their Needs, Thoughts Or Feelings In Public. Instead, They Hide Their Emotions And Let Others ‘Walk Over Them’. While A Passive Communication Style May Seem Harmless, It’s Not. Because It Makes People Believe That Such Communicators Are Powerless, Pushovers Or Uninterested, When That May Be Far From The Truth.

“I’m Unable To Stand Up For What I Believe In”

“I Just Want To Keep The Peace”

“I Will Always Agree With You Because You’re So Much Smarter Than Me!”

“You’re Right, It Was My Fault. I’m A Horrible Human Being”
